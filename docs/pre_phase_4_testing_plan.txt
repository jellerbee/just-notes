‚è∫ That's an excellent approach. Testing in real-world usage before deployment is crucial for catching issues that don't surface during
  development. A few thoughts:

  Why this makes sense:
  - You'll discover UX friction points that only emerge with actual use
  - Edge cases and bugs are easier to fix now before users depend on the system
  - You can validate the append-only architecture handles real data volumes well
  - Better to iron out issues locally than debug them in production

  What to watch for during testing:
  - Performance with larger data sets (100+ bullets, many wikilinks)
  - Search quality and speed
  - Task workflow feel (does the keyboard-first approach work for you?)
  - Any data consistency issues with the append-only model
  - Browser console errors or network failures
  - Database query performance (check backend logs for slow queries)

  Suggested approach:
  - Keep a running list of issues in a file (maybe TESTING_NOTES.md)
  - Categorize as: Critical (blocks usage), Important (friction), Nice-to-have
  - Fix Critical and Important before deploying
  - Nice-to-have can be post-deployment improvements

  Current technical debt to keep in mind:
  - Tag autocomplete not implemented (placeholder only)
  - Some errors in backend logs (BigInt serialization, ts_rank casting)
  - No authentication yet (anyone with URL can access)

  Take your time testing - discovering and fixing issues now will make deployment much smoother.

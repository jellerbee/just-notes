Daily Note Page Issues:

- un-necessary border around text editor when it has focus. 
- the Text control, plus the "status block" at the bottom of it should occupy 
all available vertical space
- need a back button to quickly go back to daily note page when clicking on wikilinks.
- 

Task Page Issues:
- when a task is highlighted, clicking on the checkbox of a different and un-highlighted
toggles the highlighted task.
- checkbox needs to be bigger
- both the checkbox and the "DOING" message should be in the gutter on the left of the task list. 
The gutters width should not change when the task row is selected.
- Get this error, intermittently when checking/unchecking checkbox:
Failed to update source note: [Error: SQLITE_CONSTRAINT: FOREIGN KEY constraint failed] {
  errno: 19,
  code: 'SQLITE_CONSTRAINT'
}
Error occurred in handler for 'tasks.updateStatus': [Error: SQLITE_CONSTRAINT: FOREIGN KEY constraint failed] {
  errno: 19,
  code: 'SQLITE_CONSTRAINT'
}
- the "Keyboard Navigation" visual block that shows help on navigation is un-necessary. get rid of it.
